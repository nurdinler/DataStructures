## [Queue Using Two Stacks](https://github.com/nurdinler/DataStructures/blob/main/QueueUsingTwoStacks.c)
* A solve for a problem from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/queue-using-two-stacks/problem?isFullScreen=true)
  
  * A basic queue has the following operations:

    Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
    Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.

    In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process queries, where each query is one of the following types:

    1 x: Enqueue element into the end of the queue.
    2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
    3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
